# EAGLE library for MoaT layouts

This library holds all parts which are used by MoaT.

## EAGLE ??

Yes, I know. Not free software, and all that.

Unfortunately this is about interoperability.
Most prototyping shops don't accept KiCAD or Fritzing, and EAGLE is at
least free-beer for "small" projects, which this one qualifies at.

## License

These designs are from various sources. Since they mostly mirror existing
physical devices, I don't think designing the library templates is a
creative task, therefore these files may not actually be copyrightable.

I'm placing the library under the GPL-3 anyway, because my intent when
creating these components was and is to re-integrate improvements, which can
only happen if I actually get them. :-P

Note that this does infect the designs built with this library.
Thus, if you want to build some non-copylefted proprietary hardware
without donating the results of your effort to the community,
kindly design your own library. Thank you.
