# EAGLE library for MoaT layouts

This library holds all parts which are used by MoaT.

## EAGLE ??

Yes, I know. Not free software, and all that.

Unfortunately this is about interoperability.
Most prototyping shops don't accept KiCAD or Fritzing, and EAGLE is at
least free-beer for "small" projects, which this one qualifies at.
